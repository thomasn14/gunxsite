# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal-ish

This is Kristoff's minimal-ish starter template for [Astro](https://astro.build).
It includes a few extras to help you get started, but is still very minimal.

## âœ¨ Features

- `<Container>` component to center your content and provide padding
- `<SkipLink>` component for accessibility
- Global CSS reset
- Starter theme with CSS variables
- Pre-configured import aliases for `@components`, `@layouts`, `@assets`, and `@content`
- Samples showing the following:
  - importing & using an image
  - importing & using a component
  - importing & using a Markdown file as a component
  - using CSS variables for theming
  - importing and using a Google Font with `@fontsource`

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
